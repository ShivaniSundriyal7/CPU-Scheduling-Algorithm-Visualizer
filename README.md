# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm-Visualizer

This CPU Scheduling Simulator is a command-line program written in C++. 
<\br>
It allows users to simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms including:

- First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduler
- Round Robin (RR)

**Features**
</br>
- **Menu Driven Interface:** Users can select the scheduling algorithm they want to simulate from a menu.

- **Process Definition:** Users can choose to use predefined processes or introduce new processes.

- **Visualization:** The simulator provides a visual representation of the scheduling process, showing the order of execution and waiting times.

- **Support for Multiple Algorithms:** Users can choose from multiple CPU scheduling algorithms to simulate different scenarios.

- **Quantum Setting:** For Round Robin scheduling, users can specify the time quantum for scheduling.
